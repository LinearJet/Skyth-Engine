## ‚ú® Key Features

SKYTH is packed with features that go beyond a simple chatbot, creating a versatile tool for information discovery and creation.

-   **üß† Agentic Core:** At its heart, SKYTH uses an LLM-based router to analyze user intent and dynamically select the most appropriate tool or pipeline, moving beyond simple keyword matching.
-   **üìö Multi-Layered Memory:** A persistent, multi-component memory system (`Core`, `Episodic`, `Semantic`, `Resource`) allows the AI to learn user preferences and maintain context across conversations.
-   **üåê Real-Time Research:**
    -   **Standard Research:** Executes an LLM-planned, multi-step search strategy using DuckDuckGo for comprehensive answers.
    -   **Deep Research:** Scrapes and analyzes multiple web sources using `Trafilatura`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Selenium` to automatically generate detailed, styled HTML reports, complete with embedded media and a downloadable PDF version.
-   **üé® Dynamic & Multimodal Interaction:**
    -   **Image Analysis:** Understands and answers questions about user-uploaded images.
    -   **Image Editing:** Edits images based on user prompts (e.g., "add a hat to the person").
    -   **Image Generation:** Creates new images from text descriptions using Google's Gemini models.
    -   **File Analysis:** Extracts and analyzes text from PDFs and other documents.
    -   **Voice Synthesis:** Provides streaming text-to-speech audio using Microsoft Edge's high-quality neural voices.
    -   **Audio Transcription:** Transcribes user-uploaded audio files.
-   **üìä Interactive Visualizations:**
    -   **Data & Math:** Generates interactive HTML5 Canvas visualizations (using `p5.js`) for mathematical functions, physics concepts, or data.
    -   **Financial Data:** Fetches and displays real-time stock data in interactive `Chart.js` graphs.
-   **üíª Coding & HTML Assistant:**
    -   **Code Generation:** Writes, explains, and debugs code in various languages.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your own instance of the SKYTH Engine running locally.

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python and `pip` are installed and accessible from your terminal.
-   **Node.js**: Required for the stock data fetching script. Install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
-   **Chrome & Chromedriver**: Required for Selenium-based scraping. The Chromedriver version must match your installed Chrome browser. Download it from the [Chrome for Testing availability dashboard](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) and ensure it's in your system's `PATH`.
-   **FFmpeg**: Required for audio processing (`pydub`). Install it from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and ensure `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are in your system's `PATH`.
-   **API Keys**:
    -   **Google Gemini API Key**: The application relies heavily on Gemini for its core functionalities. Get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LinearJet/Skyth-Engine.git
    && cd Skyth-Engine
    ```

2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    # For Unix/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    The stock data script uses a Node.js library. Navigate to the project root and run:
    ```bash
    npm install yahoo-finance2
    ```

5.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys and a secret key for Flask sessions.
    ```env
    # .env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
    SECRET_KEY=generate-a-super-secret-random-string-here
    PORT=5000
    
    # For Google OAuth (Optional, but required for user login)
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Initialize the Database:**
    The application will automatically create and initialize the `memory.db` SQLite database on the first run.

2.  **Start the Flask Server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

3.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You can now start interacting with the SKYTH Engine.
